<p>Before we even begin to consider the concepts of programming, it stands to reason that we must first have a good idea of what it really is. What is computer programming? What is a programming language? How are those two things connected? These questions are more difficult than they sound and are not so easily answered. The ideas are all too slippery and defy simple definition. It is probably no surprise then that most tutorials on the topic dodge this problem and rush straight into teaching skills and practice rather than ruminating on what that practice really is. We won’t make much of an attempt to provide proper definitions here either but we will at least spend a while on explaining programming in some of its historical and technical context before we begin in earnest.</p>
